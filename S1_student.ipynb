    "# Introduction to Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is run in a Jupyter notebook. Jupyter is a programming environment for python that combines sections of code (so called <i>cells</i>) with cells containing HTML text, just like regular websites. The nice thing about this is that it actually is an interactive notebook in which you can run python code, making the code easier to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before the assignment starts, we will tell you the basics of jupyter which you need to know to do this assignment. For a more extensive list, you can visit [this website](https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Navigating the notebook\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> You can select a cell by single clicking it. You can see that the cell is selected by the <font color='blue'>blue line</font> on the left. <img src=\"example_selectedv2.png\" alt=\"Example showing when a cell is selected.\">\n",
    "    <li> Once a cell is selected, you can navigate up and down using the arrow keys <b>ðŸ •</b> and <b>ðŸ —</b> respectively.\n",
    "    <li> To run a selected cell, press the <b>Run</b> <img src=\"run_example.png\" alt=\"Example showing the run button.\"> button on the top or use <b>Shift + Enter</b>. This will automatically select the next cell.\n",
    "    <li> In case something goes wrong, you can restart the kernel with <b>â†»</b> or go to <b> Kernel -> Restart </b>. It is also possible to restart and clear the output (deleting all variables) or restart and run all (automatically runs the whole notebook). \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Editing the cells\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> A code cell can be edited by single pressing on the place you want to place your cursor. Note how the bar on the left is <font color='green'> green </font>\n",
    "    <li> A text or markdown cell can be edited by double clicking it. This is also indicated in throughout the notebook and you will use this to answer the questions. The required answers are only textual so no special commands are needed. However, if you want to use more advanced formatting, you can search the 'desired formatting option + HTML' to find the corresponding HTML command for it.  \n",

    "<font color = 'blue'> In this task, you will improve the network. You might have noticed from the previous task that the losses and cable loading are very high for several lines. This is caused by the way generators are modelled. Generators are implemented as PV buses, meaning their active power `p_mw` and voltage `vm_pu` setpoints are enforced. The generator at bus 4 has a voltage of 1.0 pu while the external grid to which it is closeby is 1.02 pu. The large voltage drop across the line results in a huge reactive power flow in the line which also causes active power losses. In short, the current configuration is sub-optimal.\n",

    "Try to fix this issue by testing the following two options:\n",
    "<ol> \n",
    "<li> Change the voltage setpoint `vm_pu` to 1.02 to match that of the external grid. You can use `net.gen.at[x, 'vm_pu'] = 1.02` to access the voltage setpoint of the x-th generator. Use the `net.gen` command to find the corresponding index; if Task 2 was done correctly, this should be 0.\n",
    "<li> Remove the line between bus 1 and bus 4. Use `net.line` and `net.bus` to find the index of the desired line. Note that the indeces can differ depending on the order in which you created the lines.
